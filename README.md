Naming Convention: Follow the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) naming convention for CSS class names.
Variables: Use SCSS variables for colours, font sizes, and other reusable values.
Mixins: Leverage SCSS mixins for reusable blocks of styles.
Nested Selectors: Take advantage of SCSS nested selectors for a more organized and intuitive structure.
